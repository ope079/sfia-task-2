# DevOps Core Practical Project





## The Brief
Below is my implementation of the SFIA Devops Core Practical Project. In this project, my task is to create an application composed of a service-oriented architecture which runs 4 APIs as different services. The core service, and the frontend is Service 1, and it is responsible for communicating with the three others. Services 2 and 3 will act as random object generators, and service four will combine their results and this will be presented to the user on the front end. The application must run as a CD pipeline making use of containerisation, a CI server and an orchestration tool. And the app must run via a reverse proxy as a load balancer.
